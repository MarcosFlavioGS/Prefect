A C package manager if you are too lazy for Makefile.

## Overview

Prefect is a powerful C package and project manager crafted with the elegance of OCaml. It simplifies the entire project lifecycle, from creating a new project with a standardized C project structure to building, running, and generating project dependencies like Makefiles or specific structures for 42 school projects such as MiniShell, FDF, ft_printf, Libft, and more.

## Features

### Create Project

Prefect makes project initiation a breeze. It sets up a comprehensive C project structure with directories like src, obj, include, test, and bin. To create a new project, use the following command:

``` sh
prefect new <project_name>
```

This command not only creates the necessary directories but also initializes a Git repository for version control.

### Build Project

Building your C project is a seamless process with Prefect. It compiles your source code, taking care of compiler flags and other configurations. To build your project, run:

``` sh
prefect build
```

Prefect can also build to object files.

``` sh
prefect build -o
```

It will compile the object files and put them inside your obj/ directory.

### Run Project

Executing your C project is as simple as running:

``` sh
prefect run
```

This command ensures that your project is compiled and then executes the compiled binary.

### Generate Project Dependencies

Need project-specific configurations like Makefiles or 42 school project structures? Prefect has you covered. To generate project dependencies, use:

``` sh
prefect generate <dependencie_type>
```

Replace <dependency_type> with the specific dependency you need, such as Makefile.

## Getting started

### Installation

### *Release*

The binary is available on the release page [Release](https://github.com/MarcosFlavioGS/Prefect/releases)

There is currently no command to install Prefect. Create an alias to Prefect executable by simply cloning the repository, cd into it then run:

``` sh
dune build
```
Then just add to your shell config file(.bashrc, .zshrc...) the line:

```sh
alias prefect="~/path/to/Prefect/_build/default/bin/prefect.exe"
```

## Examples

### Creating a new project

``` sh
prefect new my_c_project
```

This command creates a new C project named "my_c_project" with the standard project structure.

### Generating a Makefile

``` sh
prefect generate makefile
```

the generate command, as well as all other commands, can be used in it's short form:

``` sh
prefec g makefile
```
